# QR Code Generator with Go and Fiber

This project is a simple QR Code generator built using the Go programming language with the [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) web framework and the [go-qrcode](https://github.com/skip2/go-qrcode) package. The frontend uses HTML and Bootstrap for styling.

## Features

- Enter a URL or any text in the input field.
- Submit the form to generate a QR code.
- The QR code is dynamically created and displayed in the iframe.
- If no QR code is generated, the default image is shown.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go 1.22 or later (Download from [here](https://golang.org/dl/))
- A text editor/IDE of your choice (e.g., VS Code, GoLand)

### Install Go Dependencies

In your project directory, run the following command to install the required Go dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This will install the necessary libraries, such as Fiber and go-qrcode.

### Running the Server

1. **Start the Go server**: 

   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. **Access the application**: 

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the QR code generator interface.

### Frontend: HTML Form

The frontend consists of an HTML form where users can input a URL or text. Upon submission, the form sends a `POST` request to the `/generate` endpoint, which returns a dynamically generated QR code.

- The default image is displayed until a QR code is generated.
- Once the form is submitted, the server responds with the QR code image, which is displayed inside the `<iframe>`.

### Backend: Go Server

The Go server uses the following:

- **Fiber Framework**: To handle HTTP requests.
- **go-qrcode**: To generate QR codes from the input text.

When the form is submitted, the server generates a QR code and sends the image as a response, which is displayed in the frontend.

### Example Flow

1. **Open the page**: When you navigate to `http://localhost:8000`, you will see the default image with an input field.
2. **Enter a link**: Enter a URL or any text into the input field.
3. **Submit the form**: When you click the "Generate" button, the form is submitted to the backend, and the QR code is generated and displayed inside the iframe.
4. **Result**: The QR code is displayed, and users can scan it.

### Troubleshooting

If the QR code is not showing up:

1. **Check Go Server Logs**: Make sure there are no errors when generating the QR code.
2. **Check Browser Console**: Ensure there are no JavaScript or network errors in the developer tools (F12).
3. **Ensure Correct Form Submission**: The form should be correctly submitting to `/generate`, and the response should load into the iframe.
